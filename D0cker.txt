I have heard that Docker may not be the greatest isolation tool. Can you proove it?

Hints:

    This is not a kernel exploitation challenge
    You don't need to exploit the oracle

[*] Spawning a task manager for you...
[*] Spawning a Docker container with a shell for ya, with a timeout of 10m :)
[*] Your task is to communicate with /oracle.sock and find out the answers for its questions!
[*] You can use this command for that:
[*]   socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/oracle.sock
[*] PS: If the socket dies for some reason (you cannot connect to it) just exit and get into another instance
